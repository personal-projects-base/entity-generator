# Gonthera CLI Project

Use this skill for code or documentation changes in the `gonthera-cli` project.

## Project Purpose

`gonthera-cli` is a Maven plugin/JAR that reads `project.json` from the current working directory and generates code for service projects. It temporarily falls back to the legacy `properties.json` when `project.json` is absent.

Configuration lookup order:

1. `.gonthera/project.json` with optional separated files;
2. root `project.json`;
3. root legacy `properties.json`.

When `.gonthera` exists, its `project.json` is required. `entities.json`, `endpoints.json`, and `enums.json` contain arrays directly; `messaging.json` contains the messaging object; `authorization.json` contains the Java authorization customization object. All sections may still remain inside `.gonthera/project.json`; each separated file overrides only its corresponding section. The loader merges them into the same `Properties` model used by single-file configuration.

Validation is available without generation through `mvn gonthera-cli:validate` or `gonthera-cli.exe --validate`. Validation requires `.gonthera`, checks JSON syntax and shape, rejects unknown properties at any nesting level, and then applies the shared semantic `ProjectValidator`. It must not create or delete generated output. Root configuration remains temporarily supported for generation only.

Supported targets:

- `JAVA`: Spring/JPA style generation under `src/main/java/<mainPackage>_gen`, organized into `entities`, `dtos`, `converters`, `repositories`, `services`, `controllers`, `endpoints`, `enums`, `common`, and `messaging` subpackages; resources remain under `src/main/resources`.

Java CRUD controllers delegate persistence, conversion, filtering, pagination, and transactions to generated `*Service` classes. `serviceAbstract: false` generates a concrete Spring `@Service`; `serviceAbstract: true` generates an abstract class without `@Service` and must produce a validator warning that the consumer needs a concrete Spring bean. Prefer `generateDefaultControllers` and `controllerAbstract`; accept `generateDefaultHandlers` and `handlerAbstract` only as deprecated aliases with warnings and new-name precedence.
- `DOTNET`: C# generation under `<mainPackage>_gen`, physically organized into `Entities`, `Dtos`, `Converters`, `Repositories`, `Controllers`, `Endpoints`, `Enums`, `Common`, `Data`, and `Messaging`; static files remain under `static`. Generated C# files currently retain the shared root namespace `<mainPackage>.<mainPackage>_Gen` despite the physical folders.
- `NODE`: TypeScript/Express generation under `src/generated` plus a Prisma/PostgreSQL `prisma/schema.prisma`, with CRUD converters, relations, query parsing, database configuration, and optional RabbitMQ. MongoDB is pending.
- SQL: PostgreSQL script generation as `postgree.sql`.
- Messaging: RabbitMQ generation under `messaging.RabbitMq`.

Java authorization classes are generated under `<mainPackage>_gen.authorization`. `authorization.authenticateAbstract` and `authorization.tenantConfigurationAbstract` default to `false`. When enabled, the corresponding generated class is abstract and has no Spring stereotype, so the consumer must provide one concrete Spring bean outside `_gen`.

## Java CRUD Architecture

For every Java entity that is not `onlyDTO`, the generated CRUD flow is:

```text
HTTP request
    -> <Entity>Controller
    -> <Entity>Service
    -> <Entity>Repository
    -> database
```

The generated classes have deliberately separate responsibilities:

- `controllers/<Entity>Controller.java` owns the HTTP boundary. It implements `common/CrudController`, receives request bodies and path variables, parses CRUD list query parameters, and delegates to the service. It must not perform repository access, DTO conversion, filtering, or transaction management.
- `services/<Entity>Service.java` owns the CRUD use-case implementation. It coordinates the repository, DTO converter, filtering, pagination, and transaction boundaries.
- `repositories/<Entity>Repository.java` owns Spring Data persistence.
- `converters/<Entity>DTOConverter.java` maps between generated DTOs and entities.
- `common/CrudController.java` defines the standard Spring MVC CRUD mappings shared by generated controllers.

The old generated names are a breaking compatibility boundary:

- `handlers/<Entity>Handler.java` became `controllers/<Entity>Controller.java`;
- `common/HandlerBase.java` became `common/CrudController.java`;
- custom classes that extended a generated Handler must extend the generated Controller instead;
- imports, class names, filenames, and tests in a consumer project must be migrated from `handlers`/`Handler` to `controllers`/`Controller`;
- `generateDefaultHandlers` and `handlerAbstract` remain accepted only as deprecated JSON aliases. New configuration and consumer code must use `generateDefaultControllers` and `controllerAbstract`.

### Generated service behavior

The generated `<Entity>Service` exposes overridable public methods:

- `save(dto)`: converts the DTO to a new entity, saves it, and converts the persisted entity back to a DTO;
- `update(dto, id)`: converts the DTO to an entity, forcibly applies the path `id` to the entity key, saves it, and returns the resulting DTO;
- `delete(id)`: calls `repository.deleteById(id)`;
- `get(id)`: obtains `repository.getReferenceById(id)` and converts the result to a DTO;
- `getAll(input)`: normalizes a non-positive offset to `1`, converts the public one-based page offset to Spring Data's zero-based page index, creates a `PageRequest` with optional `field,asc|desc` ordering, applies `SpecificationFilter`, queries the repository, and returns `ResponseData` with total, contents, size, and the zero-based result offset.

Current list-query limitations must remain visible when adapting a consumer:

- the controller defaults `size` to `20` and `offset` to `1`;
- `filter`, `order`, and `displayFields` are read from query parameters and used by the service;
- `order` accepts `field,asc` or `field,desc`, defaults to ascending when direction is omitted, and accepts dotted relationship paths;
- there is currently no generated upper-bound validation for `size`;
- service methods are not `final`, and the generated repository, converter, and filter fields are `protected`, specifically so subclasses can override behavior when configured for customization.

Transaction rules:

- `save`, `update`, and `delete` use `@Transactional`;
- `get` and `getAll` use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`;
- transaction ownership belongs to the service, not the controller;
- when an override changes transaction semantics, declare the appropriate `@Transactional` annotation explicitly on the overriding method;
- keep slow external calls and unrelated orchestration outside a database transaction unless the use case intentionally requires otherwise.

### Concrete and abstract service rules

`serviceAbstract` controls whether Gonthera supplies the Spring bean or only the reusable base implementation.

With `serviceAbstract: false` (the default):

- Gonthera generates a concrete `<Entity>Service` annotated with `@Service`;
- the generated controller can inject and use it immediately;
- use this mode when no service customization is needed;
- do not add another ordinary Spring bean extending this concrete service unless bean selection is intentionally resolved, because injection by `<Entity>Service` type can become ambiguous.

With `serviceAbstract: true`:

- Gonthera generates `public abstract class <Entity>Service` without `@Service`;
- its CRUD methods still have working concrete implementations and may be inherited, selectively overridden, or called through `super`;
- the generated abstract class is not a Spring bean and cannot satisfy controller injection by itself;
- the consumer must provide at least one concrete subclass registered as a Spring bean;
- normally there should be exactly one bean assignable to `<Entity>Service`; if there are multiple implementations, the consumer must resolve injection with `@Primary` or `@Qualifier`;
- the implementation must live outside generated `_gen` sources, because regeneration replaces generated files.

Recommended consumer implementation:

```java
package com.example.service.services;

import com.example.service_gen.dtos.CustomerDTO;
import com.example.service_gen.services.CustomerService;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@Service
public class CustomerApplicationService extends CustomerService {

    @Override
    @Transactional
    public CustomerDTO save(CustomerDTO dto) {
        // Consumer-specific validation or normalization.
        return super.save(dto);
    }
}
```

Inherited `protected` dependencies are injected by Spring into the concrete subclass. Prefer overriding only the methods whose behavior actually differs. Calling `super` preserves the generated CRUD implementation; omitting it means the consumer owns the complete behavior and return contract of that method.

### Concrete and abstract controller rules

The controller flags are independent from `serviceAbstract`:

- `generateDefaultControllers: false`: no default controller is generated for that entity; the service is still generated unless `onlyDTO` is true. The consumer owns the complete HTTP adapter.
- `generateDefaultControllers: true` and `controllerAbstract: false`: generates a concrete `@RestController` ready to use.
- `generateDefaultControllers: true` and `controllerAbstract: true`: generates an abstract controller containing the standard mappings and delegation. The consumer must provide a concrete Spring controller subclass.

Recommended consumer implementation for an abstract generated controller:

```java
package com.example.service.controllers;

import com.example.service_gen.controllers.CustomerController;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class CustomerApplicationController extends CustomerController {
    // Override only endpoints that need consumer-specific HTTP behavior.
}
```

Rules for controller customization:

- keep custom concrete controllers outside `_gen`;
- do not redeclare the same class-level or method-level mappings unless the URL contract is intentionally being replaced;
- do not create a second concrete controller over the same generated routes while the default generated controller remains active, because Spring can report ambiguous mappings;
- controller overrides should handle HTTP concerns and delegate business/persistence work to the service;
- if the consumer wants total control of routes, prefer `generateDefaultControllers: false` and implement its own controller instead of subclassing the default concrete controller.

### Safe configuration combinations

Use these combinations when adapting a generated Java project:

The flags belong to each object inside `entities.json` or the `entities` array in `project.json`:

```json
{
  "entityName": "customer",
  "generateDefaultControllers": true,
  "controllerAbstract": true,
  "serviceAbstract": true,
  "onlyDTO": false,
  "entityFields": []
}
```

The empty `entityFields` above only highlights flag placement; it is not a valid complete entity. A real entity must declare its fields and exactly one key according to the validation contract.

| Goal | `generateDefaultControllers` | `controllerAbstract` | `serviceAbstract` | Consumer responsibility |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| CRUD ready without customization | `true` | `false` | `false` | None |
| Customize only business rules | `true` | `false` | `true` | Implement one concrete `@Service` subclass |
| Customize only the HTTP adapter | `true` | `true` | `false` | Implement one concrete `@RestController` subclass |
| Customize controller and service | `true` | `true` | `true` | Implement one concrete controller and one concrete service |
| Own all HTTP routes | `false` | ignored | either | Implement the controller; implement the service too only when `serviceAbstract` is `true` |

`onlyDTO: true` takes precedence over CRUD generation: the Java generator skips entity-backed repository, service, and default controller generation for that item. Do not instruct a consumer to subclass CRUD artifacts that do not exist for an `onlyDTO` entity.

### Validation and migration expectations

The validator must:

- reject non-boolean values for `generateDefaultControllers`, `controllerAbstract`, and `serviceAbstract`;
- warn when `generateDefaultHandlers` or `handlerAbstract` is used;
- use the new property when both a new name and its legacy alias are present, and warn about the conflict;
- warn when `serviceAbstract: true` because generation cannot verify that the consumer actually supplies a concrete Spring bean.

When asked to migrate a consumer project, inspect its generated-code extensions and Spring beans before editing. Rename Handler imports/classes to Controller, move business overrides to a concrete generated-service subclass where appropriate, keep HTTP-only overrides in the controller, and check for duplicate beans and duplicate request mappings after the migration.

## .NET CRUD Controllers

The .NET generator no longer produces `*Handler` or `*HandlerImpl`. For each entity with `generateDefaultControllers: true`, it produces one `Controllers/<Entity>Controller.cs`:

- `controllerAbstract: false` generates a concrete ASP.NET Core controller;
- `controllerAbstract: true` generates an abstract controller with working CRUD implementations;
- all CRUD actions are `virtual`, so a consumer subclass can selectively override them and call `base` to preserve generated behavior;
- `generateDefaultControllers: false` generates no CRUD controller for that entity;
- the deprecated `generateDefaultHandlers` and `handlerAbstract` aliases still resolve through the shared model, emit warnings, and are never used as generated class names.

Unlike Java, the current .NET CRUD Controller still injects `I<Entity>Repository` directly and owns DTO conversion and CRUD orchestration. Do not tell a .NET consumer that `serviceAbstract` generates a C# service: that property remains Java-only. Adding .NET services requires a separate design that also updates `AddScoped`, constructor injection, templates, and consumer migration.

When `controllerAbstract: true`, a consumer implementation must remain outside `_gen`, pass `I<Entity>Repository` to the base constructor, and be a concrete controller discoverable by ASP.NET Core:

```csharp
public class CustomerApplicationController : CustomerController
{
    public CustomerApplicationController(ICustomerRepository repository) : base(repository)
    {
    }

    public override ActionResult<CustomerDTO> Save(CustomerDTO input)
    {
        return base.Save(input);
    }
}
```

The .NET output directories are physical organization only for now. Templates still emit the common root namespace, so consumer imports do not gain `.Controllers`, `.Repositories`, or other folder suffixes in this version. Never infer namespace structure from the directory names until the templates are explicitly migrated.

## Must Read First

Before making non-trivial changes, inspect:

- `docs/handoff/gonthera-cli-project/HANDOFF.md`: implementation-oriented behavior and known limitations.
- `docs/handoff/HANDOFF_FRONTEND.md`: frontend-facing JSON and query contracts.
- `README.md`: user-facing instructions.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: current release notes and future improvements.
- Relevant generator package:
  - Java: `src/main/java/com/gonthera/cli/service/java`
  - .NET: `src/main/java/com/gonthera/cli/service/dotNet`
  - Node: `src/main/java/com/gonthera/cli/service/node`
  - Shared: `src/main/java/com/gonthera/cli/service/common`
  - Models: `src/main/java/com/gonthera/cli/model`

For docs-only changes, inspect the static portal in `docs/index.html`, `docs/app.js`, and `docs/styles.css`. Also inspect `docs-docusaurus/docs` and `docs-docusaurus/sidebars.js` when the Docusaurus copy is in scope.

## project.json Contract

The minimum valid shape must include arrays even when empty:

```json
{
  "mainPackage": "com.example.service",
  "projectName": "service-name",
  "language": "JAVA",
  "entities": [],
  "endpoints": [],
  "enums": []
}
```

Accepted `language` values are uppercase:

- `JAVA`
- `DOTNET`
- `NODE`

The structural validator rejects unknown JSON properties before generation. Do not document unsupported properties as active behavior, even though Gson itself would otherwise ignore them.

## Entity Field Shape

Use the real field shape:

```json
{
  "comment": "Identificador",
  "fieldName": "id",
  "list": false,
  "fieldProperties": {
    "fieldType": "uuid",
    "required": true,
    "valueDefault": ""
  },
  "metadata": {
    "nullable": false,
    "key": true
  }
}
```

Do not use simplified field examples like top-level `fieldType` or top-level `nullable`; the implemented model uses `fieldProperties.fieldType` and `metadata.nullable`.

## Relationships

Java and C# relationship generation are mature. Node relationship generation is also mature for Prisma with PostgreSQL as of 2.1.3; MongoDB remains pending.

Relationship fields use `relationShips`:

```json
{
  "fieldName": "parentCode",
  "list": false,
  "fieldProperties": {
    "fieldType": "costCenter",
    "required": false,
    "valueDefault": ""
  },
  "metadata": {
    "nullable": true,
    "key": false
  },
  "relationShips": {
    "fetchType": "LAZY",
    "relationShip": "ManyToOne",
    "bidirectional": false,
    "reference": true
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `bidirectional: false`: owner side. Generates FK/column and `@JoinColumn` in Java.
- `bidirectional: true`: inverse side. Uses `mappedBy` and does not generate SQL column.
- `mappedBy`: must point to the owner field, for example `children` maps by `parentCode`.
- `reference: true`: normally set on the FK/reference side; Java converters use it to avoid recursion.
- `list: true`: collection side, usually `OneToMany` or `ManyToMany`.
- Node supports bidirectional `OneToOne`, paired `ManyToOne`/`OneToMany`, `ManyToMany`, multiple relations between the same models, and self-relations.
- Node validates missing or ambiguous inverse fields, invalid `mappedBy`, incompatible cardinalities, and FK name collisions before cleaning generated output.
- Node relationship inputs use nested objects containing the configured key. Never expose synthetic Prisma FK names as the HTTP contract.
- Node output expands related DTOs and assigns `null` to the immediate reciprocal field to prevent circular repetition.

Example inverse side:

```json
{
  "fieldName": "children",
  "list": true,
  "fieldProperties": {
    "fieldType": "costCenter",
    "required": false,
    "valueDefault": ""
  },
  "metadata": {
    "nullable": false,
    "key": false
  },
  "relationShips": {
    "fetchType": "LAZY",
    "relationShip": "OneToMany",
    "mappedBy": "parentCode",
    "bidirectional": true,
    "reference": false
  }
}
```

## Messaging

Messaging is grouped by provider. Current provider:

```json
{
  "messaging": {
    "RabbitMq": {
      "pub": [],
      "sub": []
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Generate RabbitMQ code only when `messaging.RabbitMq` exists and has at least one `pub` or `sub` channel.
- Do not generate RabbitMQ dependencies/configuration when `RabbitMq` is absent, null, or empty.
- Keep the exchange outside `project.json`; Java/.NET use annotation/attribute in consumer code, Node uses a concrete config class.
- The old `pup` typo must not be reintroduced. Use `pub`.
- The old `events`/`listeners` model is not implemented; do not document it as current behavior.
- Node uses `amqp-connection-manager` 5.0.0 with `amqplib` 2.0.1. Reuse one concrete `RabbitConfig` so publishers and subscribers share the connection.
- Node publishers use confirm channels and connection-manager buffering. Subscribers restore setup after reconnect, apply `prefetch`, acknowledge successful handling, and reject failures without requeue by default.
- Keep connection URL, exchange, error policy, runtime startup, and shutdown in consumer-owned files outside `src/generated`.

## Node.js Scope

Node 2.1.3 generation for Prisma/PostgreSQL includes:

- models/DTO contracts and entity metadata;
- enums;
- transactional Prisma repositories;
- DTO/entity/Prisma converters with cycle protection;
- Express controllers and routes with uniform CRUD errors;
- endpoint contracts;
- query parsing for filters, order, projection, and pagination;
- abstract `configuration/database/DatabaseConfig`;
- RabbitMQ connection, publisher, and subscriber abstractions when configured;
- static files;
- SQL;
- a complete PostgreSQL `prisma/schema.prisma`, including supported relations.

Node does not generate:

- `package.json`;
- `tsconfig.json`;
- `.env`;
- migrations;
- a concrete database configuration;
- Express application/server bootstrap, error middleware, Swagger, or authentication;
- a concrete RabbitMQ configuration and listener implementations.

Node controller customization supports the same inheritance intent as Java. `generateDefaultControllers: false` suppresses the generated controller and route. With `controllerAbstract: true`, generate an abstract base with implemented CRUD methods, a protected repository, and normal prototype methods so subclasses can call `super`. Generated route handlers must invoke the controller through wrappers to preserve `this` and dispatch overrides.

`GeneratedControllerFactories` is the runtime composition contract. A factory property is required for every abstract controller and optional for concrete controllers. `createGeneratedRoutes(prisma, factories)` keeps all HTTP bindings generated; the consumer provides only its concrete subclass and a registry entry such as `customer: repository => new AppCustomerController(repository)`. Keep a runtime missing-factory error in each abstract route in addition to the TypeScript requirement. Do not make generated routes import consumer files or require consumers to repeat CRUD bindings.

Node runtime contract:

- Keep `src/generated` disposable. Consumer customization belongs outside it.
- Receive relationships as DTO objects containing their real key, such as `{"customer":{"id":"UUID"}}`; do not accept or return synthetic fields such as `customerId`.
- `reference: true` connects an existing record. Non-reference relationships may create or update nested data in the same transaction.
- PUT preserves omitted fields. An explicitly supplied inverse OneToMany collection removes omitted children; ManyToMany replaces links without deleting shared rows.
- GET/POST/PUT expand relations but replace the immediate reciprocal field with `null`; expansion is bounded to six relationship hops.
- Lists return `{size, offset, total, contents}`. Request page numbering starts at 1 and response `offset` is zero-based.
- Entities must have exactly one scalar primary key. The route stays `/:id`, while generated code resolves and converts the configured key name and type.
- MongoDB is not implemented yet. Do not describe the PostgreSQL Prisma schema or relation persistence as Mongo-compatible until item 9 is complete.

## Templates

The generator source uses `.mxsd` templates under `src/main/resources/xsd`.

Use templates for generated code instead of large inline string literals.

Template folders:

- `xsd/java`
- `xsd/dotnet`
- `xsd/node`
- `xsd/sql`

User-facing documentation should not explain internal templates unless the user explicitly asks about generator development.

## CRUD Filters

Java and Node share the public query parameter names and core response expectations, while their internal query engines remain target-specific.

- Java `SpecificationFilter` supports `eq`, `isNull`, `notNull`, date-only inclusive comparisons with `gte`/`ge` and `lte`/`le`, `and`, `or`, and dotted relationship paths. Date comparisons accept ISO `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime` values.
- Java string `eq` is a case-insensitive contains operation; UUID uses exact equality.
- Java numeric, boolean, and date equality is not safely converted by the current template.
- Do not claim reliable mixed `and`/`or` precedence, nested parentheses, escaping, comparison operators, or `in` support.
- .NET `DynamicFilter` is a separate dialect with `eq` and one logical operator kind per expression; collection paths use `*`.
- Node supports `size`, `offset`, `filter`, `order`, and `displayFields`; `filter` accepts `eq`, `isNull`, `notNull`, date `gte`/`ge` and `lte`/`le`, dotted paths, and collection paths with dotted syntax or `*`.
- Node string `eq` is case-insensitive contains; UUID is exact; enum accepts name or ordinal; numeric and boolean equality values are converted.
- Node rejects mixed `and`/`or`, parentheses, escaping, list ordering, unknown fields, and invalid values with HTTP 400. Missing GET IDs return 404.
- When filter behavior changes, update both entity handoffs and the relevant user documentation.

## Documentation Standards

Update docs when behavior changes:

- `README.md`: user-facing usage.
- `docs/handoff/gonthera-cli-project/HANDOFF.md`: implementation details and caveats.
- `docs/handoff/HANDOFF_FRONTEND.md`: frontend request construction and limitations.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: release notes and future improvements.
- `docs/index.html`, `docs/app.js`, and `docs/styles.css`: public static portal, examples, version status, and the global language selector.
- `docs-docusaurus/docs`: detailed user documentation.

Docusaurus docs should focus on how to use the generator, not how the generator is implemented.

The static portal is language-scoped. The selector in the introduction controls every section below it. Keep installation, generated code, relationships, CRUD, filters, messaging, security, runtime, and limitations inside the selected target data in `targetDocs`; do not reintroduce mixed Java, Node, and .NET comparison cards in the page body. Shared JSON contracts may stay in `snippets` only when their implemented shape is identical for all targets.

For .NET and Node docs, mention that consumers can download `gonthera-cli.exe` or `gonthera-cli-x.x.x.jar` and execute it in the project root, in the same folder as `project.json`.

## Validation

Prefer focused validation over full `mvn test` when generated `_gen` sources or local dependency state make full tests noisy.

Useful compile check for generator sources:

```bash
find src/main/java/com/gonthera/cli -name '*.java' ! -path '*cli_gen*' > /tmp/gonthera-cli-sources.txt
rm -rf /tmp/gonthera-cli-compile
mkdir -p /tmp/gonthera-cli-compile
javac -cp /home/geovane/.m2/repository/org/projectlombok/lombok/1.18.28/lombok-1.18.28.jar:/home/geovane/.m2/repository/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.10.1/gson-2.10.1.jar:/home/geovane/.m2/repository/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-api/2.23.1/log4j-api-2.23.1.jar:/home/geovane/.m2/repository/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/2.23.1/log4j-core-2.23.1.jar:/home/geovane/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-annotations/3.9.0/maven-plugin-annotations-3.9.0.jar:/home/geovane/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/maven-plugin-api/3.9.3/maven-plugin-api-3.9.3.jar -d /tmp/gonthera-cli-compile @/tmp/gonthera-cli-sources.txt
```

Docusaurus validation:

```bash
cd docs-docusaurus
npm run build
```

When validating generation, create a temporary project under `/tmp`, copy or create `project.json`, execute `Main` or the compiled classes from that folder, then inspect generated output.

## Editing Rules

- Use existing package patterns; do not invent a parallel architecture.
- Keep manual generated-code templates in `.mxsd` files.
- Do not change generated output paths unless explicitly requested.
- Do not revert unrelated dirty files.
- Do not edit generated `_gen` output as source of truth.
- Describe Node as mature for Prisma/PostgreSQL only. Keep MongoDB, authentication, migrations, and consumer bootstrap listed as pending or consumer-owned until implemented.
